The results are expressed as dilutions.  A higher number means a stronger antibody response, suggesting a possible infection.\n",

            "**2. Dengue Serology:** This test checks for dengue fever.  The results are negative for all three markers tested:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** Negative –  This means the test didn't detect a protein produced early in dengue infection.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgG:** Negative – This means the test didn't detect antibodies that show past infection with dengue.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgM:** Negative – This means the test didn't detect antibodies that indicate a recent dengue infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube.  A higher rate often indicates inflammation in the body.\n",

            "* **ESR 1st Hour 26 mm/hr:** This is significantly higher than the normal range (0-8 mm/hr), suggesting inflammation.\n",

            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** 40.5% (Normal) – The percentage of red blood cells in the blood.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** Shows the percentages of different types of white blood cells. All are within or near the normal ranges.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **HbA1c 5.4%:** This is within the normal range for someone who isn't diabetic, indicating good blood sugar control.\n",
